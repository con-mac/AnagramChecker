# AnagramChecker
A program written in Java to detect if 2 given words are an anagram of each other.

This program uses an anagram Class to compare and validate to user word inputs along with a username. 
It then caches the inputs in an array list and stores correct inputs to text file.

(NEWBIE!!)

************************************************************************************
KNOWN ISSUES:

I feel i was succesful in the basic implementation of the program however, there were a few tasks i could not complete fully.

1. To read in the current text file inputs and store to arraylist for comparison.

2. Breaking from some of the loops could have been better. I feel further coding praxtice will help as recent modules have been theory heavy (i.e., Process Mgmt etc...)

3. Testing: I havent enough experience so far in unit testing and have not completed this section of the task. This will be an area of focus perhaps between now and September.

**** Any feedback on features that I couldn't execute correctly would be greatly appreciated. Also, feedback on any areas of my code that are working but could be improved would be awesome.

Would benifit greatly from any suggestions anyone has to improve this program.
